# ue4-processevent-intercept

This powerful library allows you to intercept all ProcessEvent calls on any game object therefore you could capture and modify 90% of game function calls, one example is you could intercept a function that creates a projectile and modify it's direction to achieve "silent" aim.

I have included an example/usage code based on Ark Survival Evolved.

In order to use this you must find the process event offset for the unreal engine 4 game you're working on, after that the library finds the process event index by using the offset.

Note: Project uses GetModuleHandleA(NULL) to get module base so if the game's module is not the main module of the process then you must change this.
